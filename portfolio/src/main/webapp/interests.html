        <p>
          When I was in high school I was very fortunate to have been given the opportunity to earn my
          private pilots license. I did so successfully, and I have enjoyed taking friends and family flying!
          I have not flown since starting college, but I hope to get back into it when I have time to in the future.
          Above are pictures of me with my flight instructor, Shannon, as well as right after my first solo flight.
