                Hi there! I am a rising 3rd year undergraduate student studying 
                Computer Science at The University of Georgia. I aspire to be
                the most competent full stack engineer that I am capable of becoming,
                and I hope to leverage these skills to build useful technologies throughout
                the course of my career. 
                </p>

                <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
                <p>
                During my time at The University of Georgia I have served as an undergraduate
                teaching assistant, participated and won awards in the university's 
                annual hackathon, maintained a 4.0 major GPA, and was recently
                selected to serve on the executive membership board for our chapter of 
                the Association for Computing Machinery.

          I created this website along with my two teammates during a hackathon called UGAHacks 7, and
          we won the Major League Hacking Best use of Google Cloud Award! The website helps students and
          faculty find or advertise free food on campus instead of relying on group chats.

        <p class="indent">
          We used Firebase to host the website and database. We constructed database tables in Firebase, 
          and connected to them using JavaScript. The front end of the website was developed using HTML, 
          CSS, and JavaScript. We used the Google Maps API to display the map and add the markers, and 
          we were able to implement a sign in page that enables the user to sign in with their google 
          account using the Firebase documentation

            This website helps users organize information about their applications to jobs and/or internships.
            It was a semester long team based project for a web programming course. I used PHP 
            and SQL to build the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end. XAMPP was used 
            to run servers on the localhost, and the website was not published. Learning how to use PHP and 
            SQL to update and retrieve data from the database was the greatest challenge since the need to 
            move applications to any category required a lot of queries. Implementing these queries successfully
            and teaching myself these backend technologies was very rewarding!

            When I was in high school I was very fortunate to have been given the opportunity to earn my
            private pilots license. I did so successfully, and I have enjoyed taking friends and family flying!
            I have not flown since starting college, but I hope to get back into it when I have time to in the future.
            Above are pictures of me with my flight instructor, Shannon, as well as right after my first solo flight.
