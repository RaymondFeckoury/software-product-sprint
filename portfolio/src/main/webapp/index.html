            <p>
              Hi there! I am a rising 3rd year undergraduate student studying 
              Computer Science at The University of Georgia. I aspire to be
              the most competent full stack engineer that I am capable of becoming,
              and I hope to leverage these skills to build useful technologies throughout
              the course of my career. 
            </p>

            <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
            <p>
              During my time at The University of Georgia I have served as an undergraduate
              teaching assistant, participated and won awards in the university's 
              annual hackathon, maintained a 4.0 major GPA, and was recently
              selected to serve on the executive membership board for our chapter of 
              the Association for Computing Machinery.
