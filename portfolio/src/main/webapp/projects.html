          I created this website along with my two teammates during a hackathon called UGAHacks 7, and
          we won the Major League Hacking Best use of Google Cloud Award!
        </p>
        <p>
          We used Firebase to host the website and database. We constructed database tables in Firebase, 
          and connected to them using JavaScript. The front end of the website was developed using HTML, 
          CSS, and JavaScript. We used the Google Maps API to display the map and add the markers, and 
          we were able to implement a sign in page that enables the user to sign in with their google 
          account using the Firebase documentation
        </p>
        <p>
          The theme of the challenge we entered was to "reduce the friction" that people face when trying
          to do something. We decided to build a website that helps students find or advertise free food
          on campus instead of using groupchats.

        This website was my semester long team based project for a web programming course. I used PHP 
        and SQL to build the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end. XAMPP was used 
        to run servers on the localhost, and the website was not published. Learning how to use PHP and 
        SQL was the greatest challenge since the need to move applications to any category required a lot
        of functionality.
